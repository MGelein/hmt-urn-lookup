# URN Convertor
During the first sessions of the HMT project I noticed the lookup of URNS for specific persons, places or folio images could be a bit cumbersome. You had to manually look through the right files on the github. This small web application provides you with one location where you can look through all three URN tables.

## Use The Site
You can view the live version of this website [here](http://www.interwing.nl/hmt/urn/)

Depending on the type of URN you can copy (in case of a person or place URN) it to your clipboard or you open the folion URN you're clicking in the HMT [Image Citation Tool](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/)

### Credits
All credit for the data goes to the Homer Multitext project, their data curators and researchers. All of the data this website uses is pulled live from their GitHub.

All of the scripting, design and testing has been done by myself, Mees Gelein. Any part of this code can be freely reused by others both commercially or non-commercially.
